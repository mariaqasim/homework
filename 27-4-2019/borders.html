     <br> Historically, <b><i>ASCII</b></i> developed from telegraphic codes.Work on <b><i>ASCII</b></i> formally began <b>October 6, 1960</b> with the first meeting        of the <b>American Standards Association</b> (ASA) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published during <b>1963</b>, a major revision        during <b>1967</b>, and the most recent update during <b>1986</b>.It is binary code used by electronic equipment to handle text using the English alphabet,        numbers,and other common symbols. <b><i>ASCII</b></i> is an abbreviation for <b>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</b>. <b><i>ASCII</b></i> was         developed in the <b>1960s</b> and was based on earlier codes used by telegraph systems.<br><br>

      <b>What is Unicode in computer?</b><br><br>

      Unicode is an entirely new idea in setting up binary codes for text or script characters. Officially called the <b>Unicode Worldwide Character Standard</b>,it is a system for "the interchange, processing, and display of the written texts of the diverse languages of the modern world."<br><br>

      <b>Why is it needed?</b><br><br>

      They store letters and other characters by assigning a number for each one. Before Unicode was invented, there were hundreds of different encoding systems for assigning these numbers.<br><br>

     <br>Because the character sets in ISO-8859 were limited in size, and not compatible in multilingual environments, the <b>Unicode Consortium</b> developed the Unicode Standard.The Unicode Standard covers 
     (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.Unicode enables processing, storage, andtransport of text independent of platform and language.The default character encoding in <b>HTML-5</b> is <b><i>UTF-8</b></i>.<br><br>

     <br>Unicode is a character set. UTF-8 is encoding.<br>
     Unicode is a list of characters with unique decimal numbers (code points). A = 65, B = 66, C = 67, ....<br>
     This list of decimal numbers represent the string "hello": 104 101 108 108 111<br>
     Encoding is how these numbers are translated into binary numbers to be stored in a computer:<br>
     <b><i>UTF-8</b></i> encoding will store "hello" like this (binary): 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100  01101111<br>
     <b>Encoding</b> translates numbers into binary. Character sets translates characters to numbers.<br><br>
